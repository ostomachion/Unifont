    <h1>Unifont Glyph Modifications and Extensions</h1>

    <h2>Emoji Glyph Normalization</h2>

    <p class="note">
        <strong>&#x26a0; Note:</strong> After reading through the nuances of text vs. emoji style presentations, the
        scope of this goal will be simplified and this section will be rewritten. The majority of this section is no
        longer valid.
    </p>

    <p>
        The first goal of this work is to contribute to the excellent work provided by <a href="https://www.unifoundry.com/unifont/index.html">GNU Unifont</a>
        and normalize its emoji glyphs by focusing on three consistency criteria listed below in order of priority. The
        adjustments proposed here are intended to contribute positively to the project, ensuring that the emoji glyphs
        in Unifont are as cohesive, user-friendly, and standards-aligned as possible while respecting the unique
        character and legacy of the font.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Be consistent within Unifont.</strong> Many emoji glyphs in the font exhibit inconsistencies
                in shapes, sizes, and positions, both in their overall forms and in their individual components. For
                instance, while most of the &ldquo;smiley&rdquo; emoji are drawn within a standard 15&times;14 circle,
                some deviate from this standard size without a clear reason. Similarly, the shapes and positions of
                commonly used eye and mouth types can be standardized. These adjustments will help create a more
                cohesive look and feel across the set, while still allowing for individual glyphs to retain their unique
                character where appropriate.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Be consistent with the official guidelines.</strong> The glyph designs should adhere to the
                specifications and recommendations outlined in the various emoji and CLDR documents and data files.
                Extensive details can be found in the <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#Design_Guidelines">Design Guidelines</a>
                section of <cite>Unicode&reg; Technical Standard #51</cite>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Many existing glyphs appear to have been designed solely based on the formal character name and
                representative glyph in the Unicode code charts, without sufficient consideration for the information
                provided by the emoji and CLDR documents and data files. For example, the code point U+1F603 has the
                formal name &ldquo;SMILING FACE WITH OPEN MOUTH&rdquo;, but a CLDR short name of &ldquo;grinning face
                with big eyes&rdquo;. As noted in the Unicode documentation: 
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                &ldquo;The formal Unicode name of a Unicode character does not determine its appearance. [&hellip;] In many cases, 
                the consensus for the best depiction has evolved in the time since the original formal name was standardized, and 
                the preferred depiction is now better reflected by the CLDR short name.&rdquo;
            </blockquote>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Be consistent with industry practice.</strong> This criterion is specifically detailed in
                <cite><a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/"></a>Unicode&reg; Technical Standard #51</a></cite>
                but is explicitly listed here for emphasis. Many emoji fonts and vendors have agreed upon a set of
                visual conventions and styles that increase interoperability and user familiarity across platforms.
                Aligning with these practices helps maintain consistency and avoids user confusion when interpreting 
                emoji designs.
            </p>

            <p>
                While consistency with industry practices is encouraged, it is important to recognize that exact 
                replication of existing designs is neither required nor always practical. Reasonable interpretation and
                creativity in representing emoji and other icons are valid and often necessary to accommodate diverse
                design contexts or technical constraints. The goal is to balance user expectations with flexibility in
                artistic expression and functionality.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Extended Emoji Support</h2>

    <p>
        The second goal of this work is to create extensions to GNU Unifont to add full support for emoji. These
        extensions are likely out of scope for the Unifont project. The extensions include:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>glyphs for the emoji variation sequences: text style and emoji style variation sequences</li>
        <li>glyphs for the basic emoji sequences: keycap, flag, tag, and RGI modifier sequences</li>
        <li>glyphs for the emoji RGI ZWJ sequences: family, role, gender, hair, and other RGI ZWJ sequences</li>
        <li>colored versions of each emoji glyph</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>

    <p>
        The color palette used for the color glyphs is a custom palette that will be called &ldquo;Human16&rdquo; in
        this document.
    </p>

    <ul class="palette">
        <li>
            <div class="red"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="pink"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="orange"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="yellow"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="green"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="light-blue"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="blue"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="purple"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="black"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="gray"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="white"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="skin1"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="skin2"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="skin3"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="skin4"></div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="skin5"></div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The Human16 palette was carefully designed with the following goals in mind:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Be simple</strong> enough to fit with the look, feel, and philosophy of Unifont. Human16 uses only
            16 colors (not counting transparency), with no two colors being too similar. An efficient glyph encoding can
            be derived analogous to the .hex format used for existing monochrome Unifont glyphs, using four bits per
            pixel instead of one. Either a simple transparency mask can be used, or a simple algorithm can automatically
            determine the transparent pixels as none of the outermost pixels of the glyph will ever be pure white.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Be compatible</strong> with all existing emoji characters and their expected presentations. Human16
            includes the 12 colors of the explicitly colored shape emoji (hearts, squares, circles, etc), as well as the
            five skin tones from the set of skin tone modifier emoji components (one of which overlaps with the basic
            &ldquo;brown&rdquo; color).
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Be accessible.</strong> Human16 incorporates the
            <a href="https://x.com/bangwong/status/492662880760655873">colorblind safe palette</a> used by Bang Wong
            (<cite><a href="https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/html/manuals/pdf/color_blind.pdf">original source</a></cite>;
            see also
            <cite><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.1618">Wong, B. Points of view: Color blindness. <i>Nat Methods</i> <b>8</b>, 441 (2011)</a></cite>
            for more details). This palette is expanded by adding a carefully selected shade of purple and gray.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Be inclusive.</strong> Rather than the Fitzpatrick scale, Human16 derives its skin tone colors from
            <cite><a href="https://skintone.google/the-scale">Monk, Ellis. &ldquo;Monk Skin Tone Scale,&rdquo; 2019</a></cite>.
            This scale is more modern, inclusive, and representative of global skin color diversity than the Fitzpatrick
            scale. The specific tones have been modified to better match the the rest of the palette.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Glyphs</h2>

    <p class="note">
        <strong>&#x26a0; Note:</strong> This section will be expanded to include text style presentations for all code
        points and a minor rearrangement of the table. Details to come.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project will provide two new fonts called &ldquo;Comfont Emoji&rdquo; and &ldquo;Comfont Color Emoji&rdquo;
        to complement Unifont. Comfont Emoji will use the monochrome emoji style glyphs and Comfont Color Emoji will use
        the color emoji style glyphs. Both will include full emoji support for sequences and variations. These fonts
        will contain only emoji glyphs and their text variants and will be dual-licensed under the
        <a href="OFL.txt">SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1</a> and the
        <a href="LICENSE.txt">GNU General Public License Version 3</a> with the GNU font embedding exception. Unifont
        has full permission to incorporate these glyphs or redistribute these fonts when they become available. If
        Unifont does decide to fully incorporate and host these extensions, I will deprecate the Comfont fonts and
        archive this page. Otherwise, any unincorporated extensions will continue to be maintained and provided here.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following table presents the proposed glyph designs. The <b>Unifont</b> column shows the current glyph in
        Unifont 16.0.02. The <b>Comfont</b> columns show the new glyph designs in text style (if the code point has a
        text style variation), monochrome emoji style, and color emoji style.
